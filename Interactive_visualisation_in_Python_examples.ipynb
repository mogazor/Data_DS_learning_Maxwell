        "Sometimes we require interaction in our Jupyter notebooks rather than a PowerBI dashboard. A potential reason would be to employ more sophisticated technology to meet typical business intelligence use cases. Traditional BI tools are ideal for creating dashboards created from SQL or CSV data. However, when we try to display information created by more sophisticated logic, we often fall short.\n",

We may either add a few interactive controls and plots to notebooks or build completely functional applications and interactive dashboards. Both can be created with components from the built-in core widgets, such as `buttons`, `sliders`, and `dropdowns`, or with the rich ecosystem of custom widget libraries based on the Jupyter widgets framework, such as interactive maps with `ipyleaflet` or `2-D plots` with `bqplot`."
